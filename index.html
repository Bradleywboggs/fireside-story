    <p>It was a dark and stormy night. The children were huddled by the warm fire.
      They were frighted by the sounds of the thunder and the wind.
      To help calm the children, mom made some hot cocoa and added three marshmallows to each mug.

      The kids were so happy to have the hot drink and it helped to distract them from the storm.</p>

      There was a knock at the door.</p>
